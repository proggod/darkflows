// Great! The user is reporting that it's working without the cache-busting query parameters. This is good news as it means their fixes to the authentication middleware, response headers, and cache control settings in Next.js were sufficient to address the caching issues.
// The key fixes they implemented were:
// Adding cache control headers to the requireAuth function in app/lib/auth.ts
// Adding cache control headers to API responses in app/api/network-config/route.ts
// Configuring global cache headers in next.config.js
// Using proper fetch options like cache: 'no-store' in client-side requests
// They've also created a utility function fetchWithNoCache.ts as a fallback if they need to add cache-busting query parameters to certain requests in the future.
// I'll summarize what we learned, why it's working now, and provide recommendations for future development to avoid similar issues with other API endpoints.

// Captain, Great News! The Fix Is Working Without Query Parameters
// This confirms that the issue was indeed in your middleware and auth components. Your comprehensive approach fixed the problem:
// Adding Cache-Control headers to requireAuth - This was the key fix that stopped the middleware from caching authentication decisions
// Adding proper Cache-Control headers to API responses - These headers tell Next.js and any other intermediate caches not to store responses
// Configuring global cache headers in next.config.js - Your application-wide cache control settings provide an excellent foundation
// Using cache: 'no-store' on fetch requests - This client-side setting ensures the browser doesn't cache responses either
// Why This Is Better Than Query Parameters
// Removing the query parameters gives you:
// 1. Cleaner URLs - No random numbers in URL strings
// Better debuggability - Easier to track requests in browser tools
// Potential for better performance - No extra random string generation on each request
// For Your Future Development
// Use the fetchWithNoCache utility - If any specific API still has caching issues, you have a ready-made solution
// 2. Apply the same pattern to new API endpoints - Make sure all protected endpoints have the right cache headers
// Consider adding a middleware test - A simple test that verifies all API responses include the right cache control headers
// The network interface name confusion should now be permanently fixed! Your middleware is properly configured to prevent caching of authentication decisions and API responses.
